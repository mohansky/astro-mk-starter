# Modern CSS Techniques for 2024

CSS continues to evolve rapidly, bringing powerful new features that make styling more intuitive and maintainable. Let's explore some exciting techniques you should know.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow you to style elements based on their container's size, not just the viewport:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid Subgrid

Subgrid allows nested grids to participate in their parent's grid:

```css
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}

.nested-grid {
  grid-column: span 2;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

## Logical Properties

Use logical properties for better internationalization:

```css
.element {
  margin-inline-start: 1rem;
  border-inline-end: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding-block: 2rem;
}
```

## CSS Layers

Organize your CSS with cascade layers:

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  body {
    font-family: system-ui;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .button {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
  }
}
```

## Advanced Selectors

New pseudo-selectors for better targeting:

```css
/* Style elements that have specific children */
.parent:has(.special-child) {
  background: yellow;
}

/* Select elements within a range */
li:nth-child(n+3):nth-child(-n+7) {
  color: blue;
}
```

These modern CSS features help create more responsive, maintainable, and accessible designs. Start experimenting with them in your next project!
